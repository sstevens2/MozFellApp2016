Dear Mozilla Science Lab,  
\
I am passionate about creating a supportive environment for researchers learning computation.
I founded and maintain a computational biology support group and two language specific study groups to further this goal on my campus.
Recently I began leveraging the Mozilla study group resources for my own study groups and now join in on the monthly calls.
I am active in both the local and global Software and Data Carpentry communities, and my study groups provide continued support for workshop attendees.
I taught and helped with several workshops, developed new lesson materials, and created tutorial videos.
My work with Software Carpentry and Mozilla study groups has given me skills to collaborate remotely, which I used to teach git and bitbucket to my lab's overseas collaborators using google hangouts.
My experience promoting open and reproducible science on my campus and teaching and working remotely make me a perfect fit for this fellowship.  
\
When teaching scientists about reproducible research I tell them to take one step at a time; choose one piece they learned, use it until they have become comfortable with it, and then repeat.
This fellowship is the next step for me, allowing me to grow the open community here at UW-Madison and take on new projects in the open science community.  
\
Thank you for your consideration,  
\
